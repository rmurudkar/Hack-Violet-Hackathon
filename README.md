# Hack-Violet-Hackathon
A mobile app that acts as an anonymous community to monitor mental health that can be especially useful during quarantine/self-isolation. The user would be able to go onto the app and log how theyâ€™re feeling each day in a clean and user-friendly interface. The user would also be able to set personal goals to ultimately better their health and well-being. The app also includes breathing excersise for when users are anxious or stressed.

# What's Next For Lilac?
Currently, any user can enter his/her thoughts, concerns, or feelings. Users can set and manage their goals to help with personal stability. We intend to add a login/signup feature using Firebase to enforce a firm and secure system for the users.
