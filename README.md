# Hack-Violet-Hackathon
a mobile app that acts as an anonymous community to monitor mental health that can be especially useful during quarantine/self-isolation. The user would be able to go onto the app and log how they’re feeling each day in a weekly calendar-based interface. The user would also be able to engage in a anonymous forum-based community like reddit but without the dm feature. Users wouldn’t have any username or profile pic shown in the community in order to remain anonymous. Ideally, continuous use of the app would also allow them to view trends of their logged emotions/triggers.
